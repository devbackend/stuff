Run a pre-commit code review on local staged and unstaged changes, present findings in Plannotator, auto-fix approved issues, then verify.

**Usage:** `/devbackend-review [context]`

The optional `[context]` argument describes what was being worked on — a task description, Jira ticket, or change request. When provided, the reviewer checks whether the changes actually fulfil the stated requirements.

## Step 1 — Collect findings

Build the agent prompt. If context was provided in the command arguments, include it:

```
Review all local staged and unstaged changes and return all FINDING blocks.

Pay special attention to edge cases: boundary values, nullability, type limits, and "impossible" scenarios that could fail with future changes.

For each finding, mark it as BLOCKING (correctness bugs, security issues, edge cases, requirements mismatches) or SUGGESTION (style, naming, minor improvements, personal preferences).

<If context provided:>
Change context (check that the changes match these requirements):
<context>
```

Use the Agent tool to launch the `code-reviewer` subagent with that prompt.

If the result is `NO CHANGES` or `NO FINDINGS` — tell the user and stop.

## Step 2 — Build the checklist

For each FINDING block, read the relevant lines from the source file to extract a code snippet (3-7 lines centred on the finding line).

Build a markdown checklist. If context was provided, include it at the top:

```markdown
# Code Review

> **Context:** <context>

> N findings. Check items to fix, uncheck to skip.

## <Category>

- [ ] **<subject>** `[BLOCKING]` or `[SUGGESTION]` — `<file>:<line>`
  ```<lang>
  <code snippet>
  ```
  <explanation and recommended fix>
```

Group findings by category (Security, Performance, Go, SQL, Rust, Requirements, etc.).

Requirements findings (changes don't match the stated context) go in a dedicated `## Requirements` section.

## Step 3 — Write to a temp file

```bash
_tmp=$(mktemp /tmp/devbackend-review-XXXXXX)
REVIEW_FILE="${_tmp}.md"
mv "$_tmp" "$REVIEW_FILE"
```

Write the markdown checklist to `$REVIEW_FILE`.

## Step 4 — Open in Plannotator

Run via Bash:

```bash
plannotator annotate "$REVIEW_FILE" --json
```

Parse the response:
- `"decision": "approved"` or `"decision": "dismissed"` → acknowledge and stop
- `"decision": "annotated"` → proceed to Step 5

## Step 5 — Auto-fix approved findings

From the feedback, identify which findings the user approved for fixing.

For each approved finding, launch the appropriate agent via Agent tool:
- Go findings → `Agent(subagent_type="golang-dev", prompt="Fix: <finding subject and context>")`
- SQL findings → `Agent(subagent_type="postgres-dev", prompt="Fix: <finding subject and context>")`
- Other findings → fix inline using Edit/Write tools

## Step 6 — Verify

Re-launch the `code-reviewer` subagent to verify no issues remain:

```
Agent(subagent_type="code-reviewer", prompt="Review all local staged and unstaged changes and return all FINDING blocks.")
```

Report the result:
- `NO FINDINGS` → "✅ All fixed findings verified — no remaining issues."
- Findings remain → list what still needs attention.
